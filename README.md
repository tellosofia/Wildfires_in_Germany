# Wildfires_in_Germany
The number of fires and burned hectares in Germany and in the world has been increasing in the past years, specially during the past decade. A number of factors contribute to fires but climate change is a high driver. The weather is getting warmer and dryer, causing the forests to have higher vulnerability to fires. In this project we explore the ocurrance of fires in each state of Germany and it's relation with different weather variables, and use machine learning to predict the vulnerability of each region taking into account the time of the year, precipitation, temperature and other weather variables.
